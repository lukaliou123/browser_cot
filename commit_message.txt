feat: implement data model and storage service

This commit adds a robust data structure and storage mechanism for the thought chain extension:
- Create data models for ThoughtNode and ThoughtChain
- Implement StorageService with Promise-based API
- Update background script to use the new storage service
- Enhance popup UI to display recent thought chains
- Fix message communication between popup and background

The extension now properly stores and displays thought chains, allowing users to add pages to specific chains and view their recent activity.
